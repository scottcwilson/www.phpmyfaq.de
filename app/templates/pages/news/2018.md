The phpMyFAQ Team is pleased to announce [phpMyFAQ 3.0.0-alpha](/download), the "17 years and still living" release. This
new major pre-release marks a big step ahead with the changed PHP requirement to PHP 5.6+ and PHP 7+. We finally added
PHP namespaces, Docker support, a LDAP configuration frontend, a configuration for enable/disable XML sitemaps, support
for category images and categories on homepage, an image slider template, an improved attachment overview, HTML5 export
and we're ready for the EU General Data Protection Regulation. We improved our REST API including login and the sticky
records feature. We switched CSS development from LESS to SCSS and our template variable syntax is now compatible with
Twig/Handlebars. Our new mobile first template is based on Bootstrap v4. We removed the translation admin frontend, the 
XHTML export, support for ext/mssql, the bundled Symfony ClassLoader and Bower, we're now using NPM/Yarn only. Please
don't use this version in production systems, but test this version and please report bugs!
