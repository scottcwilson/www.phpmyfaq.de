<p>
  The phpMyFAQ Team has learned of some security issues that have been discovered in phpMyFAQ 2.9.8 and
  earlier. phpMyFAQ contains cross-site request forgery and cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.
</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  phpMyFAQ does not implement sufficient checks to avoid XSS and CSRF. All these vulnerabilities need administrator
  privileges to be executed.
</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>
  The phpMyFAQ Team has released the new phpMyFAQ versions 2.9.9 which fix the vulnerabilities. All users
  of affected phpMyFAQ versions are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible to this latest version.
</p>

<h2>Workaround</h2>
<p>
  There's no workaround except installing phpMyFAQ 2.9.9.
</p>
